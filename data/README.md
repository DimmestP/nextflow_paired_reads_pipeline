# data

### 5PSeq

Contains an input folder with the fasta files, gff files and meta data files required to run the paired_reads_pipeline.nf on the 5PSeq data set. Also, contains an placeholder output file to hold the ouputs of the pipeline.

### QuantSeq

Contains an input folder with the fasta files, gff files and meta data files required to run the paired_reads_pipeline.nf on the QuantSeq data set. Also, contains an placeholder output file to hold the ouputs of the pipeline.

### shared_data
Contains the fasta files and gff files for the raw plasmids and genome usead to create the reference files for each sample in both the 5PSeq and QuantSeq input folders. (Required to run code/pre_processing/generate_genome_gff_and_fasta.Rmd)
