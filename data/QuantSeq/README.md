# QuantSeq
The file structure of this repo is based on the inputs and outputs of the paired_reads_pipeline.nf ran for the QuantSeq dataset

### input
Contains the processed and raw data required to run the pipeline, e.g. fasta and gff files.

### output

Contains the outpus of various stages of the Nextflow pipeline script. Although, the largest outputs (such as BAM or BED files) are typically sent straight to the lab datastore.
